                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>One of the most widely discussed topics in the technological sector
                             in recent years is blockchain technology.
                             It’s technology has advanced quickly and has begun to have a big
                             impact on different industries. Cybersecurity is one of the areas where
                             blockchain technology has proven promising prospects.
                            <br> <br>
                            But before we delve deeper into the rise of blockchain technology and its impact
                            on cybersecurity, we shall start with some basic theory.

                            <h4>What is Blockchain Technology? </h4>

                            Blockchain is a decentralised, distributed database
                            that securely and immutably stores data and records transactions.
                            The technology is renowned for its capacity to offer trust,
                            security, and transparency in a distributed network.

                            </p>

                            <h2 class="section-heading">Rise of Blockchain Technology</h2>

                        <p>With the launch of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, in 2009,
                            blockchain technology became increasingly popular. Since then,
                            technology has advanced quickly, leading to the emergence of
                            numerous new cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Dogecoin,
                            and Tether.
                            <br><br>
                             In addition to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology
                             has found use in a number of industries, such as voting systems,
                             healthcare, and supply chain management.</p>

                             <h2 class="section-heading">Impact of Blockchain Technology in Cybersecurity</h2>
                        <p>The blockchain is a secure and dependable system for data storage
                             and transmission because of its decentralised and distributed
                             nature. The cybersecurity landscape is changing in a number of
                             ways thanks to blockchain technology, including the following:</p>

                             <h3>1. Decentralised Security</h3>
                             <p>Traditional cybersecurity systems rely on a central authority or server
                                 to secure data, making them centralised systems. They are therefore
                                 susceptible to data leaks and cyberattacks.
                                 <br><br>
                                However, because blockchain technology is decentralised,
                                data is saved and validated across a number of network nodes.
                                Hackers will find it considerably more difficult to access the
                                 system and steal information as a result.</p>

                             <h3>2. Immutable Data Keeping</h3>
                                <p>Once a block is uploaded to the blockchain, it cannot be changed
                                    or removed due to blockchain technology. As a result, the
                                    blockchain is a perfect tool for record-keeping because
                                     it makes data unchangeable and impervious to tampering.
                                     <br><br>
                                    Blockchain technology can thus be applied to processes
                                    like financial transactions, where data integrity is essential.</p>
                             <h3>3. Cryptographic Security</h3>
                                <p>Advanced cryptography methods are used by blockchain technology to
                                    secure data. This encompasses digital signatures, hashing, and public-key
                                     cryptography.
                                     <br><br>
                                    Hackers are unable to alter data on the blockchain as a result of these
                                    encryption methods.</p>
                              <h3>4. Smart Contracts</h3>
                              <p>In smart contracts, the details of the agreement between the buyer and seller
                                 are directly encoded into lines of code. These contracts self-execute.
                                 When specific circumstances are met, they automatically carry out since
                                 they are kept on the blockchain.
                                 <br><br>
                                The danger of human mistake can be decreased by
                                automating complicated procedures like supply chain management.</p>
                              <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>Blockchain technology is revolutionising cybersecurity by offering
                                    a safe and decentralised platform for data transit and storage.
                                    It is the perfect technology for a variety of applications due to its
                                    decentralised structure, immutability, and cryptographic security.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We can anticipate seeing more cutting-edge blockchain applications
                                    in the field of cybersecurity as technology progresses.</p>
