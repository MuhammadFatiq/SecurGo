                        <h2 class="section-heading">Background: </h2>
                        <p> At the beginning of this month (5 May 2023),
                            I had the opportunity to participate in the Magnet User Summit CTF
                            organised by Magnet Forensics. One of the challenges that caught my attention
                             was the Android Forensics category. At that point, I was just
                             starting to delve into the world of Cybersecurity, and I wasn't very familiar
                             with forensics. Instead of relying on specialised tools,
                              I primarily worked with the raw data provided in the Logical Data.
                            <br><br>
                            But now, things have changed!
                            I've become more acquainted with forensics tools like ALEAPP, and
                            I've gained a deeper understanding of their capabilities.
                            In this blog post, I'll be sharing my experiences and documenting the findings
                            I've made using these tools.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Finding Device Information </h2>

                        <p>When conducting Android forensics (be it for this CTF or not :P ), one of the crucial aspects
                            is gathering device information. Using ALEAPP, I could analyse the system logs, databases and
                            other artifacts. <br><br> Here is an example of the usage of ALEAPP to find the information of
                            the device:

                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="assets/img/androidforensics/device_info.png" alt="
                        Image showcasing the device information of the Android system  " />

                        <p>And this was conveniently the solution for a few CTF challenges too! These pieces of information
                            was found in the index.html file of the data after being processed by ALEAPP.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Finding Account Data</h2>

                        <p>In the realm of Android forensics, uncovering account data can be of paramount importance.
                            This can encompass information related to accounts (email addresses, usernames, associated services, etc.)
                            , providing insights into the user's digital footprint. <br><br>
                            Through the Accounts_ce report function of the ALEAPP processed data, I could find the twitter handle
                            and an e-mail account.

                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="assets/img/androidforensics/account_report.png" alt="
                        Image showcasing the account information found  " />

                        <p>To dive further in, the processed data also has information on the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Queued Messages
                            of the user's twitter activity such as tweets.
                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="assets/img/androidforensics/tweets_fcm_dump.png" alt="
                        Image showcasing the account information found  " />


                        <h2 class="section-heading">Chrome Login Data</h2>

                        <p> With ALEAPP, I was able to derive the Chrome login data of the user, uncovering saved
                            usernames, passwords and associated websites. In the digital forensics aspect, this invaluable
                            information not only sheds light on the user's online accounts but also offers
                            potential avenues for further investigation.
                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="assets/img/androidforensics/Chrome_Login_Data.png" alt="
                        Image showcasing the account information found from Chrome Login Data logs." />

                        <p> To say the least, I was rather amused that one could derive passwords from just the Logical Data of
                            a device. It's astonishing to think that a seemingly innocuous collection of data could
                        hold such sensitive and personal infromation.</p>


                        <h2 class="section-heading">Battery Percentage Information </h2>
                        <p>I was pretty surprised to discover that there was actually data associated with
                            battery percentages in Android devices, and I didn't think that there was any significance of this
                            seemingly mundane piece of information.
                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="assets/img/androidforensics/battery_report.png" alt="
                        Image showcasing the battery log found  " />

                        <p>However, upon further research, I found out that battery logs can actually be useful, serving
                            as crucial component in reconstructing the timelines of events, uncovering anomalies. It also
                            provides a perspective on the usage patterns and can challenge witness statements or other digital evidence.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading"></p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion: </h2>
                        <p>To think that I have only scratched the surface of forensic tools and techniqiues is truly mind-boggling.
                            I realised that there is so much more to explore and discover, especially with the continuous expansion of the
                            array of powerful forensic tools available.  <br><br> It's humbling to consider the vast amount of knolwedge and expertise that
                            forensic professionals possess in this field, and the more I delve deeper into digital forensics, the more I realise
                            that I have merely touched the tip of the iceberg. <br><br> I have to say though, this realisation fuels my curiousity
                            and motivates me to continue my journey in the world of digital forensics, and I am more than excited to dive deeper
                            into the vast sea of forensic tools and techniques.
