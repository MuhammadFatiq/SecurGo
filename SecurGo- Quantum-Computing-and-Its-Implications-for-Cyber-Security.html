                        <p>Quantum computing has been a buzzword in the tech industry for some time.
                            It’s a brand-new computing innovation that will undoubtedly change how we
                            process information. Quantum computers use quantum bits (or qubits),
                            which can exist in multiple states simultaneously (combination of both 0
                            and 1) — opposed to conventional computers that use bits (0 or 1) to encode
                            information. This allows them to perform certain computations faster than
                            traditional computers, making them valuable in fields such as cryptography
                            and financial modelling.
                            <br> <br>
                            Cryptography, one of the cornerstones of cybersecurity, involves the
                             process of encoding message so that only authorised parties can read them.
                              At the moment, encryption replies on mathematical problems that are difficult
                              to solve, like factoring large numbers into primes. Thus, deciphering encrypted
                               messages would be impractically time-consuming even with the most powerful
                               computers now in use. However, given that quantum computers have the potential
                               to solve these mathematical puzzles much more quickly, their potential
                               implications for cybersecurity are significant.<br> <br>However, quantum computers
                                have the potential to break these mathematical problems much faster using Shor’s
                                 algorithm. <br>

                            </p>



                            <h2 class="section-heading">Shor's Algorithm</h2>
                              <!--Insert Shor's Algorithm Image here-->
                              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="assets/img/shors-algorithm.png" alt="
                              Image showcasing the structure of shors algorithm " />

                        <p>Shor’s algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently factor large numbers.
                             With a quantum computer (with enough qubits), it utilises Shor’s algorithm to break
                              modern encryption methods, rendering them useless.</p>
                        <p>The possibility of quantum computers decrypting data has caused considerable
                            worry in the cybersecurity community. It’s not just a hypothetical risk;
                            researchers have already shown that small-scale quantum computers may be
                            used to break basic encryption. The threat to encryption will only increase
                             as quantum computers develop in strength.</p>

                        <p>However, researchers are focusing on creating new encryption techniques resistant
                            to quantum computing attacks in order to combat the threat of quantum computers cracking
                            cryptography. For instance, the post-quantum cryptography utilises mathematic problems
                            that are still difficult to solve, even with quantum computers. In fact, post-quantum
                             cryptography algorithms are now being evaluated by the National Institute of Standards
                              and Technology (NIST) to determine which ones should be standardised for usage
                              in the future.
                        </p>

                        <p>In addition to post-quantum cryptography, another promising solution to
                            the threat posed by quantum computing is quantum key distribution (QKD).
                             QKD allows for the creation of a shared key between two parties using
                             the principles of quantum mechanics, making it secure against interception
                             by a third party. Even if a quantum computer were to crack the encryption used
                             to transmit the key, it would not be able to read the key itself, making QKD a
                             promising solution for secure communication in the post-quantum era.</p>

                        <p>Quantum computing has the power to transform industries, and cybersecurity is no exception.
                            However, the threat of quantum computers cracking encryption is very real.
                            But don’t worry, researchers are already working hard to develop new encryption
                            methods that can withstand quantum attacks. The future of cybersecurity lies in
                             a combination of cutting-edge technology and a relentless pursuit of innovation
                              and research.</p>
